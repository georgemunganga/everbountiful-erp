## Phase 7 – Validation & Rollout Plan

Objective: execute comprehensive testing, prepare operations for change, and deploy the unified inventory system with controlled risk.

---

### 7.1 Testing Strategy
- [ ] Compile regression test suite covering legacy flows (purchases, sales, HRM modules).
- [ ] Add new automated tests for each movement type, lot allocation, and permission control.
- [ ] Create end-to-end scenario scripts (manual or automated) simulating full lifecycle: production → stock → sale → return.
- [ ] Plan performance/load tests on critical endpoints and reports.

### 7.2 Data Migration Dry Runs
- [ ] Execute migration scripts on the Phase 0 baseline database clone.
- [ ] Validate:
  - Table creation success and FK enforcement.
  - Backfilled data accuracy (counts, costs).
  - No orphaned records or data loss.
- [ ] Capture before/after metrics and highlight any anomalies for remediation.

### 7.3 Cutover Planning
- [ ] Determine deployment approach (big bang vs phased rollout).
- [ ] Define inventory freeze window if required (e.g., pause transactions during migration).
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan with criteria for aborting deployment.
- [ ] Schedule stakeholder communications (pre-go-live notice, go-live confirmation, post-go-live review).

### 7.4 Training & Support
- [ ] Deliver training sessions per role; collect sign-off.
- [ ] Publish updated SOPs, FAQs, troubleshooting guides.
- [ ] Set up “hypercare” support period with dedicated response team.

### 7.5 Monitoring & Post-Go-Live Checks
- [ ] Configure monitoring dashboards (system health, error logs, movement anomalies).
- [ ] Establish go-live checklist:
  - Stock balances reconcile with physical counts.
  - Alerts functioning as expected.
  - Accounting entries match expected costs.
- [ ] Schedule follow-up reviews (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) to gather feedback and prioritize fixes.

### 7.6 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test suites pass with documented evidence.
- [ ] Migration dry run signed off by technical lead.
- [ ] Stakeholder approvals collected (Operations, Finance, QA, IT).
- [ ] Go-live completed with post-mortem report and backlog of follow-up tasks (if any).
