## Phase 6 â€“ Security, Roles, and UX Plan

Objective: align user experience, permissions, and governance with the enhanced inventory workflows, ensuring safe operation and clear task ownership.

---

### 6.1 Role & Permission Matrix
- [ ] Audit current role definitions in `sec_role`, `sec_userrole`, and related permission tables.
- [ ] Define new capabilities required (e.g., create production batch, approve negative stock override, manage alerts).
- [ ] Update role matrix mapping operations to roles: Operations, Warehouse, QA, Finance, Admin.
- [ ] Plan migration scripts to add new permissions while preserving existing ones.

### 6.2 Approval & Override Workflows
- [ ] Identify high-risk actions needing approval: cost overrides, negative stock, lot disposal, recipe variance.
- [ ] Design approval hierarchy (primary approver, fallback).
- [ ] Specify UI cues (modal warnings, confirm dialogs) and backend enforcement (status flags, audit records).
- [ ] Integrate approval state with notifications (Phase 5 alert engine).

### 6.3 Critical UI/UX Components
- [ ] List required modals/wizards: Harvest/Egg Collection, Grading/Packing, Production-to-Inventory, Transfer, Waste, Lot Trace, Alert overrides.
- [ ] Draft low-fidelity wireframes describing inputs, validation, and confirmation states.
- [ ] Define UX copy, tooltips, and inline help to minimize operator confusion.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for tablet/phone usage in field settings.

### 6.4 Mobile/Offline Considerations
- [ ] Evaluate existing mobile strategy (if any). Determine whether to build PWA or native companion.
- [ ] Outline offline data capture requirements: forms, cached master data, sync queue handling.
- [ ] Document synchronization conflicts resolutions and error recovery flows.

### 6.5 Training & Documentation
- [ ] Plan role-based training materials (videos, quick reference cards).
- [ ] Update help center or inline help with new workflows.
- [ ] Define onboarding checklist for new staff accessing the system.

### 6.6 Security & Compliance Checks
- [ ] Review password/session management to ensure new operations respect existing security standards.
- [ ] Validate audit logs meet regulatory requirements (e.g., agriculture traceability, food safety).
- [ ] Confirm data access is restricted by role (e.g., Finance vs Operations).

### 6.7 Acceptance
- [ ] Role matrix reviewed and approved by management.
- [ ] UX prototypes validated with end users.
- [ ] Approval flows tested for common scenarios and exceptions.
- [ ] Training plan finalized ahead of Phase 7 rollout.
