dont code just research. find out how livestock module and stock work do we have a proper way of managing inventory from production or and purchases? if it does check how it works if not working proerly let fix it properly. if it does not exist at all then let me know.. i want to plan sales and how we make sales from production of eg eggs of trays from livestock prodction or sales from bought stuff like empty trays bough from a supplier.


Here’s what I found poking through the livestock and core inventory code—no changes made, just recon:

Livestock Module Scope

It only tracks farm-facing records: sheds, livestock groups, livestock entries, feed and vaccine stock/usage logs, and production logs (e.g., eggs collected, mortality, wastage, extras).
Data sits in tables like livestocks, productions, feeds, feed_usages, vaccines, vaccine_usages. They’re informational; nothing in the module maps production output to sellable products or updates the central product_information tables.
Controllers/forms let you record quantities produced or consumed but don’t push those numbers to any sales/purchase/inventory module.
Core Inventory Flow

Purchases: the purchase module feeds product_purchase_details, which the invoice module uses to compute available quantity. Stock math is “purchases minus sales”.
Sales: the invoice module’s stock_qty_check() only looks at product_purchase_details and invoice_details; it never touches productions or any livestock tables. So you can’t “sell from production” unless you manually add a purchase entry to move items into stock.
The standard stock report (report/report/bdtask_getStock) likewise only compares purchases to sales. Livestock production isn’t surfaced there.
What’s Missing

No bridge from productions to product_information or product_stock tables. Egg trays you log in livestock stay in the livestock module; they don’t become saleable inventory.
No concept of classifying livestock output or feed/vaccine usage as adjustments to central stock.
There isn’t a workflow for converting a production batch into inventory items, nor for offsetting inventory by the feed/vaccine consumption logs.
Conclusion
The livestock module is standalone record keeping. For planning or selling egg trays (or any livestock output), you’d need to build integration—a routine that translates a production log into product stock, and possibly another that consumes stock when you use feed or vaccines. Without that, sales will have to be driven either by manual purchases or custom tooling.

preapre a detailed to do list and plan to handle the following as step by step..we are checking for this checklist Got it. Here’s a plain-English guide you can hand to an AI agent developer (or keep as acceptance criteria) without role-playing and without naming any parameters.

What the agent needs to understand

Your farm handles multiple commodities (crops, livestock, eggs) but you want one unified way to record and track them.

Stock exists as products, and each incoming batch is grouped into a lot so you can trace where it came from and where it went.

Every movement of stock must be captured in a single history (in/out), so totals always match.

What the agent should be able to do

Record production

Harvests for crops (where, when, how much, quality/grade).

Daily egg collections, then grading and packing.

Livestock batches, with slaughter that creates sellable outputs.

Record purchases

Receive inputs like seed, feed, medicine, and packaging, with costs and quantities.

Update stock levels when goods arrive.

Record inventory movements

Transform one product into another (e.g., eggs pieces → trays; carcass → cuts).

Consume inputs (feed, packaging) and record waste/spoilage.

Move stock between locations.

Record sales

Sell any product, reduce stock by the correct lots, calculate cost of goods and margin.

Report and alert

Show stock on hand by product, lot, and location.

Flag low stock, old/perishable lots, and abnormal KPIs.

Summaries for production, purchases, sales, and profitability.

The minimum data the agent must keep (concepts only)

Products with a base unit and optional extra details (perishability, grades, default conversions like “30 pieces = 1 tray”).

Locations where stock is kept (fields, sheds, houses, stores, cold rooms).

Lots/Batches created whenever something is harvested, collected, slaughtered, received, or produced—each lot carries context (field/house/date/grade/batch).

A single chronological record of stock movements showing what came in, what went out, which product, which lot, which location, how much, and at what cost.

Business partners for buying and selling.

Guardrails the agent must follow

No stock change without recording it in the movement history.

Every production, purchase, sale, consumption, transform, transfer, or waste event results in movement entries that balance.

Every outflow references a specific lot; if not provided, use the oldest suitable lot by default.

Units must be consistent or convertible; if not, ask for clarification before recording.

Stock must not go negative unless explicitly allowed by you.

Costs must stay in sync: receiving goods updates average cost; transforming products passes cost from inputs to outputs.

How typical workflows should look (end-to-end)

Crops: harvest → create a lot with field/date/grade → stock increases → sales reduce specific lots.

Eggs: collect daily per house → grade → pack into trays/cartons (pieces decrease; finished packs increase) → sell packs.

Livestock: raise a batch → log feed and treatments (optional stock consumption) → slaughter → outputs increase as new lots → sell cuts.

Purchases: create supplier record if needed → receive items with quantities and prices → stock increases → cost updated.

Transfers and waste: move stock between locations, or record spoilage/damage with reasons.

Reports you should expect on day one

Current stock by product, lot, and location.

Items below reorder thresholds and suggested buy quantities.

Aged/perishable lots that should be sold first or written down.

Egg KPIs: daily/weekly production, crack rate, trays produced.

Crop yields grouped by field/variety/harvest date.

Purchases by supplier and period.

Sales, revenue, cost, and margin by product and period.

Batch or lot profitability where inputs and outputs can be linked.

Practical goals you can set for the agent

Keep egg crack rate below a chosen percentage and notify if exceeded.

Ensure oldest tomato lots are sold first and highlight any lot older than a chosen number of days.

Watch feed-to-egg or feed-to-meat efficiency and alert on sudden changes.

Maintain at least a target number of days of feed on hand; suggest orders when projected to fall below.

Produce a daily stock snapshot at a specific time.

Edge cases the agent should handle

Mixed units (pieces vs trays vs kilograms) using conversions.

Partial sales across multiple lots when one lot doesn’t cover the whole quantity.

Waste during packing or processing and its impact on cost.

Returns from customers (put back into the correct lot or into a separate downgraded lot).

Corrections when a mistake is found (reversal then correct entry, keeping audit trail).

What “done right” looks like

After any instruction, you get a short human summary and a structured record that could be saved by a backend.

The stock movement history always reconciles: all ins minus outs equals what’s on hand.

Traceability works both ways: from a sale back to the original field or house and date, and from a lot to all customers who received it.

Costs are sensible and flow through purchases and transformations into cost of goods on sales.

If required information is missing (e.g., location or unit), you’re asked a single, precise follow-up question.

Examples of natural instructions you can give it (no code)

Receive 50 bags of layer feed (50 kg each) into the store at a stated price per bag.

Collect eggs from a specific house today, note cracked count, then pack a number of trays of a grade.

Harvest a quantity of tomatoes of a certain grade from a named field into a cold room.

Sell a number of trays of a certain grade to a customer, using the oldest lots.

Show current stock by lot for egg products.

List items that need reordering this week.

Flag tomato lots older than your freshness target.

Compare feed usage versus egg output for a chosen month.

If you want, I can also rewrite this as a single compact brief you can paste into any platform as “how the agent should behave,” still without role-play or parameter names.

Slaughter/Processing wizard

Receive Goods; Allocate Lots (FIFO + manual)

Transfer Stock; Record Waste with reason

Negative stock guard; Cost override confirmation

Create/Select Lot (when manual choice is needed)

Traceability drawer (from any sale or lot)

Validation & Guardrails (built into UI)

Required fields per operation type (e.g., harvest must have field; collection must have house; sale must have customer + allocatable lots).

Units must be convertible (block save if missing conversion).

No negative stock (block or require supervisor override).

Duplicate protection (same lot + time + qty + product prompts a warning).

All edits use reverse-and-repost, not silent mutation (keeps audit trail).

What to tell the AI agent to “always do” behind the scenes

Create/attach lots for incoming/produced items.

Post every movement to the ledger (never mutate stock directly).

Allocate lots on sales using FIFO unless a lot is chosen.

Update moving average cost on receipts; carry cost through transforms; apply COGS on dispatch.

Return a short summary plus a structured record (so a backend can save it).

This checklist keeps the system generic and future-proof: tomatoes today, honey tomorrow, same flows—and the UI gives operators simple modals/wizards to capture each step without needing to know how the underlying agent or codebase is built.
